# Nature Digital Medicine — Coauthored Paper (2020)

**Lab:** Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics (John Rogers Lab), Northwestern  
**Role:** Bioelectronics Research Intern (while in high school)

## Why this matters to me
This was the project that **sparked my passion for medical devices**. Contributing in the Rogers Lab showed me how tightly **engineering, clinical needs, and translational impact** can align.

## My contributions
- Evaluated embedded sensor systems for **hydrocephalus shunt flow** detection.  
- **Characterized device drift** and validated **phantom model** experiments simulating physiological flow conditions.  
- Contributed analyses that supported the final manuscript; listed as a **coauthor** in *Nature Digital Medicine (2020)*.
