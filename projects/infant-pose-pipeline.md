# Infant Pose Lifting Evaluation (SRAL)

**Role:** Biomedical ML Research • **Environment:** CUDA-enabled Linux • **Focus:** Evaluation on retrospective, uncalibrated infant videos

## Problem
Retrospective infant videos are **uncalibrated** and **in-the-wild**, lacking physical scale and controlled capture—making 3D pose evaluation non-trivial.

## My Contributions
- **Developed pipeline** to evaluate 3D pose lifters on retrospective, uncalibrated datasets.
- **Benchmarked 8+ lifter models** using **MMPose** on a CUDA Linux system.

## Metrics Framework


## Outcomes
- Standardized, reproducible workflow for comparing lift architectures on non-calibrated infant data.
- Methodology informing downstream clinical research directions.

> **Note:** Source code, datasets, and internal figures are **withheld pending institutional clearance**. Happy to discuss approach and pseudo-code; detailed materials can be shared **under NDA**.
