# Mevacor (Lovastatin) Drug Analysis ‚Äî BME 340 Final Project

This was a two-person final report for **BME 340: Pharmaceutical Engineering: From Discovery to Therapeutics** at Northwestern University, [see course page](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/biomedical/academics/courses/descriptions/340.html).  
We analyzed Mevacor (lovastatin), the first FDA-approved statin, focusing on its development, mechanism of action, pharmacology, toxicology, clinical trials, and business context.  

## Key Contributions
- Compared lovastatin to prior therapies and demonstrated its improved outcomes.  
- Explained its **mechanism of action** as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.  
- Assessed pharmacokinetics, including CYP3A4 and grapefruit juice effects.  
- Reviewed toxicology data and clinical trials supporting FDA approval.  
- Evaluated patents, market competition, and business strategy.
